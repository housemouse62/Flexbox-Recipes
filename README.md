# Flexbox-Recipes
Using Flexbox to reimagine my first Odin assignment

28/7/2025
I've just completed the Flexbox section of the Foundations course of The Odin Project. This is the assignment at the end of this section in which I will use said Flexbox learned skills to build a webpage following the lead of the instructions. I will use this as a reimagining of the landing page for my recipes website I created through the previous section of the course, CSS. Party on. Enjoy. Below are any image credits for the page.
